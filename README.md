# On-Manifold IMU Preintegration — Summary & Notes

This repository contains concise notes and code snippets summarizing the key ideas from the paper **[“On-Manifold Preintegration for Real-Time Visual-Inertial Odometry”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02363)** by Forster et al.

## 📘 Contents
- **Markdown summaries** of the main concepts:
  - IMU measurement models  
  - Noise and bias handling  
  - On-manifold preintegration  
  - Factor graph formulation  
- **C++ code snippets** illustrating:
  - Preintegrated measurement computation  
  - Bias correction  
  - Residual and Jacobian construction  

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo provides a minimal, easy-to-read explanation of IMU preintegration targeted at:
- Students learning VIO / SLAM  
- Engineers implementing VIO systems  
- Anyone needing a lightweight reference without reading the full paper
